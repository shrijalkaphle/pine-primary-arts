                    We are all about teachers. That is why we have developed a CPD program that is created specifically with their needs in mind. Here at Pine Primary Arts, 
                    we put the teacher at the forefront of everything we do and equip them with the skills and knowledge they need to be able to teach art and creativity to 
                    their students confidently and enthusiastically. 
                    <br> <br>
                    We recognise that no two schools are the same and our CPD program is able to be personalised according to your specific requirements. Our CPD program will 
                    also enable your school to reach the art standards expected by Ofsted and your students to take pride in both themselves and their school. 
                    <br> <br>

                    Our CPD programs are effective. Not only do they enable teachers to think creatively, but through this they also help students to become critical thinkers. 
                    Ultimately, our CPD program creates happier teachers who are better able to connect with all of their students, differentiate their lesson plans and support 
                    each and every one of their students, including those with complex needs.

                    We lead a range of art clubs, including after school enrichment clubs, in primary schools across the country and provide a safe and encouraging space for 
                    those children who would like to explore their creativity outside of the curriculum. Each week, our students expand upon their learning in the classroom and 
                    learn new mediums, methods and ways to express themselves.
