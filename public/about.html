                Pine Primary Arts was founded by artist and gallerist, Rebecca Lidert. After establishing herself as a leading figure in the art world, Rebecca turned her attention 
                towards art education after discovering that there was a severe lack of art teachers in primary schools across the country. As someone who found art vital to her 
                development as a young child, this revelation dismayed her, and she sought to rectify it by creating Pine Primary Arts.
                <br> <br>
                Established in 2019, Pine Primary Arts aims to support children in exploring and developing their creative skills. Not only does Pine Primary Arts help students who 
                are differently abled, but it also makes learning more fun and engaging for students across the entire spectrum. By introducing children to new materials and mediums 
                as well as new creative practices, and equipping teachers with the necessary confidence to teach art, Pine Primary Arts ensures creativity is a core component of 
                children’s education.
                <br> <br>
                Pine Primary Arts fervently believes that art is crucial to any child’s development and is an effective way to teach children not only creativity, but essential life 
                skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving. Art is also a brilliant tool to help children build positive self-esteem and develop resilience. Indeed, Pine 
                Primary Art’s mission is simple: To make art a meaningful endeavour in school learning. As part its mission, Pine Primary Arts currently offers a range of services, 
                including CPD, Art Clubs, Year 6 Productions and CPD Consultancy in primary schools across the UK.
